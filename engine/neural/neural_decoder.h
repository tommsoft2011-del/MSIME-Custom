// Neural reranking of whole-sentence candidates.
//
// The model does not produce sentences. The word lattice (engine/quanpin/word_lattice.*) already
// decodes the typed pinyin into its n-best sentences with a kenlm trigram; this layer asks the
// character-level Transformer how likely each of those sentences is given what the user has already
// committed, and reorders them by
//
//     score = static + lambda * (neural - static)
//
// both terms in nats. That is a log-linear interpolation of the two language models, with lambda
// controlling how much the neural model is allowed to override the lattice. It cannot invent a
// sentence the lattice did not propose, which is the point: the lattice is good at coverage and bad
// at long-range choices, and the Transformer is the reverse.
//
// This replaces an earlier design that ran a per-syllable beam search over the model to generate
// sentences directly. That needed one full forward pass per beam per syllable with no K/V reuse --
// on the order of 10^10 multiply-accumulates for a dozen syllables, seconds of wall clock on the
// typing path. Scoring a small batch of finished sentences against a cached context is far less work, because
// the sentences come from the lattice for free and the batch streams the weights once.
//
// The word lattice always supplies the paths when neural reranking is enabled. Its own candidate
// does not have to be enabled for display: in that mode the lattice is only an internal candidate
// generator and the user sees the neural model's pick.
