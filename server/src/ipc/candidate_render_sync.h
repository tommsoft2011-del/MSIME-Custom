// The wait bound is load-bearing: the TSF side reads a committing reply with
// FANY_IME_COMMIT_REPLY_TIMEOUT_MS (300ms, windows/src/IPC/Ipc.h) and on a miss tears the pipe
// down and makes the user choose again. The wait is woken by the render echo, so a condition
// variable timeout (rounded up to one timer tick, ~16ms) is the only slack on top of this bound;
// together with candidate resolution it must stay well inside that budget. The frequency write
// runs after the reply and no longer competes for it. On a slow machine (battery, WebView2 paint)
// a paint regularly takes longer than 30ms, and settling against the unpainted page is exactly the
// "committed something I did not see" bug, so the bound leaves room for a slow paint. On timeout
// the caller continues with the current data and the diagnostic log records the miss. Do not
// raise this without re-deriving the TSF budget.
